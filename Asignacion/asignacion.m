function varargout = asignacion(varargin)
% ASIGNACION M-file for asignacion.fig
%      ASIGNACION, by itself, creates a new ASIGNACION or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = ASIGNACION returns the handle to a new ASIGNACION or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      ASIGNACION('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in ASIGNACION.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      ASIGNACION('Property','Value',...) creates a new ASIGNACION or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before asignacion_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to asignacion_OpeningFcn via varargin.
